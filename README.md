# evolutionary
Evolutionary algorithms for SNNs.

## Install
Some packages come directly from repositories and need installing via `pip` directly (instead of `setuptools`). So run these commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Huizerd/evolutionary
$ pip install -e evolutionary/
$ pip install -r evolutionary/requirements.txt
```

Code is formatted with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) using a pre-commit hook. To configure it, run:

```bash
$ pre-commit install
```
